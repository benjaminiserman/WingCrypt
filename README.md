WingCrypt is a minimalist WPF app that that allows Windows users to encrypt and decrypt files and folders with a password.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [You use a machine supported by .NET 6](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/supported-os.md)
- You have .NET 6 installed
- You have downloaded the file "build.zip" from the latest release

OR

- You **do not** need to have .NET 6 installed
- You have downloaded the file "standalone.zip" from the latest release

Due to low demand, standalone builds for Mac OSX and Linux are not provided. If you'd like a standalone build for Mac OSX or Linux, [contact me](mailto:winggar1228@gmail.com).

## Usage

2. Unzip the file.
3. Find the file "WingCryptWPF.exe" within the unzipped folder and run it.
